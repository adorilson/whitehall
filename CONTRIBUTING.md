# Whitehall contributing guide

This guide covers the basics of how to contribute to the Whitehall project.

Ruby code should follow the rules below and also follow the [testing guideline
s](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/tree/master/docs/testing.md).

Frontend code should follow the [css](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/tree/master/docs/css.md) and [javascript](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/tree/master/docs/javascript.md) guidelines.

## Git workflow ##

- Make a feature branch
- Work in any way you like
- Rebase your branch into logical commits before sending a pull request -
  follow our [Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
- If you're working off the [Pivotal backlog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1008986),
  include the ticket number in the pull request details
- Pull requests are automatically integration tested using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/whitehall),
  which will report back on whether the tests still pass on your
  branch
- You *may* rebase your branch after feedback if it's to include include relevant updates to the master branch. We prefer a rebase here to a merge commit as we prefer a clean and straight history on master with discrete merge commits for features
- When merging a pull request, include the Pivotal ticket in the merge commit details.

## Copy ##

- Titles and navigation links should only capitalise first letter, not every word.
- URLs should use hyphens, not underscores.
- Follow the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide).

## Code ##

- Don't commit additional whitespace
- Use ruby 1.9.2 hash syntax wherever possible
- Models should have:
  - All associations at the top
  - Then any scopes
  - Then validations
  - Then code
- Follow the [GOV.UK Ruby styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/ruby.md)
